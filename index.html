    <!-- Well, hello there!
      So glad you stopped by. Actually I wasnt expecting anybody here.

      Since you stumbled onto this, here's a brief intro.
      I'm Jeffrey Jose. In a previous avatar, I was a 
      Lead Technical Director at DreamWorks Animation. Currently
      I'm doing my MBA at Wharton.

      They say MBAs cant program. They are wrong.
